# CinaC blueprint: Demo Home - Lab with 5 hosts

This Demo contains five VMs that will be installed with a generic setup and some software. The result will be a home office lab with two Workstations, a file server, a webserver and a KALI host.

Additionally you can start a multiplayer session of Doom on the two Workstations, by running the following command after the blueprint has loaded:

	$ ww -t home demo-home.playbooks play-doom
